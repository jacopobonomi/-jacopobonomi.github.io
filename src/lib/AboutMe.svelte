		I <b>love</b> learning, (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_that_I_know_nothing"
			>I know that I know nothing</a
		>)<br />
		My biggest passion found during my life is computer science. I started as a linux system administrator
		<i>(I love GNU/Linux [since 2007] and open source)</i>, where I learned how to configure servers
		for many applications and how to configure networks. From this passion I moved on to security
		where for practice I completed many CTFs (I also have a profile on Hackthebox, if you want to
		add me), in particular in web security. <br />
		<br />
		I continued working as a web developer in a large company with legacy tools (Java, .NET and Angular),
		I met people with a lot of experience, with truly excellent design skills. <br />After this
		experience I decided to collaborate in a startup, where I became CTO in just under a year and I
		got some shares. I understood a lot about money and companies as a CTO and entrepreneur.
		<br />
		After launching the start-up I received a good proposal in a really smart and cool consulting company.
		I worked here as a software engineer (backend) and team leader where I found nice people and had
		a lot of fun, spanning many projects for more than 1 years. <br />
		<br />
		Now i'm a Tech Lead in a large book publishing company, where i'm a manager of a team, with a lot
		of responsibility. It's a really cool job, where I can learn a lot of new things, book publishing
		is a really interesting world. I work on datawarehouse, integrations, cloud migration, custom ERP
		and much more. <br />
		<br />
		<br />
		during all these years I have done a lot of consultancy, to the most diverse companies, with many
		languages ​​and software architectures

		<br />
		I enjoy writing software, I do it for 80% of my time. The remaining 20% ​​I like to use it to talk
		to interesting people, <a style="text-decoration: underline" href="#contact">click here</a> if you are one
